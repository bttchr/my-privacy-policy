**Privacy Policy for My Research App**

**Last Updated:** 10.2.2025

This application (the “App”) is developed for academic/research purposes only. It is not intended for commercial use and does not directly collect personal information from individuals.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage
- We do not store or collect personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses.
- The App may access aggregated or anonymized data through the Facebook Marketing API for research and analysis. This data is provided by Facebook in a non-personally identifiable format.
- Any data accessed is used solely for research purposes, to analyze trends and generate statistical insights. We do not use the data to identify or target specific individuals.

### 2. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- We do not sell, rent, or share any data obtained through the Facebook Marketing API with third parties.
- Aggregated findings (e.g., summary statistics) may be published in academic papers, conference presentations, or other research outputs, but these results will not contain any personal or identifying information.

### 3. Third-Party Services
- This App interfaces with the Facebook Marketing API, which is governed by Facebook’s own terms and privacy policies.
- We encourage you to review Facebook’s Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle user data.

### 4. Security
- We take reasonable measures to protect the data we handle against unauthorized access or disclosure. 
- However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 5. Children’s Privacy
- The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
- Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised accordingly.
